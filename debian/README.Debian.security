Lilypond is insecure for externally fetched data files
======================================================

The safe mode in LilyPond can be bypassed
and does not provide a sandbox which is robust
against code execution attacks (which can
e.g. happen via embedded Guile code).

If you use LilyPond to process files from untrusted sources
(e.g. a server passing input to LilyPond),
you need to deploy additional sandboxing measures.
