@macro helpusNeed
@subheading We need you!

Thank you for your interest in helping us --- we would love to see
you get involved!  Your contribution will help a large group of users
make beautifully typeset music.

Even working on small tasks can have a big impact: taking care of
them allows experienced developers work on advanced tasks, instead
of spending time on those simple tasks.

For a multi-faceted project like LilyPond, sometimes it's tough to know
where to begin.  In addition to the avenues proposed below, you can send
an e-mail to the
@uref{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-devel, lilypond-devel@@gnu.org}
mailing list, and we'll help you to get started.

These jobs generally require that you have the source code and can
compile LilyPond.

@warning{We suggest that contributors using Windows or MacOS X do
@strong{not} attempt to set up their own development environment;
instead, use Lilydev as discussed in @rcontrib{Quick start}.}

Contributors using Linux or FreeBSD may also use Lilydev, but if
they prefer their own development environment, they should read
@rcontrib{Working with source code}, and @rcontrib{Compiling}.

Begin by reading @rcontrib{Summary for experienced developers}.

@itemize
@item
Documentation: for large changes, see
@rcontrib{Documentation work}.

@item
