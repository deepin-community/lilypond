By default, vertically oriented fingerings are positioned outside the
staff; that behavior, however, may be disabled.   Attention needs to be
paid to situations where fingerings and stems are in the same
direction: by default, fingerings will avoid only beamed stems.  That
setting can be changed to avoid no stems or all stems; the following
example demonstrates these two options, as well as how to go back to
the default behavior.
