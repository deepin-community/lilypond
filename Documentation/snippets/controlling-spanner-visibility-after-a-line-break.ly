The visibility of spanners which end on the first note following a line
break is controlled by the @code{after-line-breaking} callback
@code{ly:spanner::kill-zero-spanned-time}.

For objects such as glissandos and hairpins, the default behaviour is
to hide the spanner after a break; disabling the callback will allow
the left-broken span to be shown.

Conversely, spanners which are usually visible, such as text spans, can
be hidden by enabling the callback.
