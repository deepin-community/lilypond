When a clef sign has already been displayed and it has not been changed
to a different clef, then repeating the @code{\\clef} command will be
ignored by LilyPond, since it is not a change of clef.  It is possible
to force the clef to be redisplayed using the command
@code{\\set Staff.forceClef = ##t}.
