The vertical ordering of scripts is controlled with the
@code{'script-priority} property. The lower this number, the closer it
will be put to the note. In this example, the @code{TextScript} (the
@emph{sharp} symbol) first has the lowest priority, so it is put lowest
in the first example. In the second, the @emph{prall trill} (the
@code{Script}) has the lowest, so it is on the inside. When two objects
have the same priority, the order in which they are entered determines
which one comes first.
